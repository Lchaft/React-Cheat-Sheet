What are props, What is state? (from:https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-lessons/react-state-and-props)

* "props are passed into a component, but state is local or native to the component"
* "While we cannot change props (immutable) from within a component, we can change a component's state (mutable)."

- "Props are one of the things that make React so powerful and help us make independent and reusable components."
- "The limitation of props is that we can't change the data from within the component. The data that we can change within a component is called state."

How state connects to rendering?

* when state changes our components re-render
* "Our UI gets updated when state changes. The user takes some action, like submitting information via a form, and the component holding that form has a state that is updated with the value of the user's input."
